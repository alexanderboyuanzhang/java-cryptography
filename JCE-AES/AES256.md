# Java AES 256 Encryption Decryption Example

Edited by Boyuan Zhang

## 1. AES – Advanced Encryption Standard

AES is a **symmetric encryption algorithm**. It was intended to be easy to implement in hardware and software, as well as in restricted environments and offer good defenses against various attack techniques.

AES is block cipher capable of handling **128 bit blocks**, using keys sized at 128, 192, and 256 bits. Each cipher encrypts and decrypts data in blocks of 128 bits using cryptographic keys of 128-, 192- and 256-bits, respectively. It uses the **same key for encrypting and decrypting**, so the sender and the receiver must both know — and use — the same secret key.

The class below is an encryption and decryption example, it's been used base64 encoding in UTF-8 charset. It is done for displaying the output of program. If your application, you can store and validate the data in byte array format as well.
