# Java Symmetric AES Encryption Decryption using JCE
Edited by Boyuan Zhang


Main issue with DES was the short encryption key size. Shorter the key, it is easier to break it with brute force attack. AES can use 128, 192 or 256 bit encryption. The block size used by DES is 64 bits and by AES is 128 bits. Third difference is AES uses permutation substitution over the Feistel network used by DES.


## Example AES Symmetric Key Encryption Decryption

In Java 8 we have got new classes in java.util package for Base64 encoding and decoding. It is important to encode the binary data with Base64 to ensure it to be intact without modification when it is stored or transferred.
