# Java AES Encryption Decryption Example
Edited by Boyuan Zhang

Java support many secure encryption algorithms but some of them are weak to be used in security-intensive applications. For example, the Data Encryption Standard (DES) encryption algorithm is considered highly insecure; messages encrypted using DES have been decrypted by brute force within a single day by machines such as the 
[![Electronic Frontier Foundation’s (EFF) Deep Crack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EFF_DES_cracker)].

A more secure encryption algorithm is 
[![AES](https://searchsecurity.techtarget.com/definition/Advanced-Encryption-Standard)]
 – Advanced Encryption Standard which is a symmetric encryption algorithm. AES encryption is used by U.S. for securing sensitive but unclassified material, so we can say it is enough secure.
